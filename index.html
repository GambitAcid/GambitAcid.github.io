    <p>Hi! My name is Ronnie Phillips. Born in 1989 and raised on a ranch in West Texas. I am multi-disciplinary creative and 
        aspiring data analyst who is currently running two small businesses in the firearms industry securing RFPs, RFIS, and contract awards
        from governmental agencies. Former F.A.S.T. Marine, NCRM microbiologist, US Olympic Weightlfiting Coach, CrossFit Instructor, and general
        bad apple, I enjoy a good cup of coffee, anything that has to do with the outdoors and will happily get paid in vintage guitars. 

        Also, I am a semi-professional racecar driver and a amateur tattoo artist.</p>
